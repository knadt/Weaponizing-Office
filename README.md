# Weaponizing-Office

## Introduction:
I did a talk at [0xC0ffee](https://0xc0ffee.co.za), where I discussed different ways to weaponize microsoft office.
What was different about the talk, was that these methods have been discovered prior to 2016, and did not require a lot of user interaction to execute the payloads. These methods work great with fishing attacks.

I decided not to use a standard way to present my talk, so [@MTB_m00se](https://twitter.com/MTB_m00se) introduced me to termin markdown where I found [patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat)

I recently discovered a tool called [Responder[(https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder), which I used in my talk.
I mainly used Responder to capture NTLMv2 hashes from victom machines.

I found a great [article](https://medium.com/@petergombos/lm-ntlm-net-ntlmv2-oh-my-a9b235c58ed4) explaining what is NTLMv2 hashes and what can be done with it.

Below is a short extract from the article:
> This is the way passwords are stored on modern Windows systems, and can be obtained by dumping the SAM database, or using Mimikatz. They are also stored on domain controllers in the NTDS file. These are the hashes you can use to pass-the-hash.
